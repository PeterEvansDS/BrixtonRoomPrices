# BrixtonRoomPrices

The idea of the project was to write our code as a testable and maintainable Python package with entry-points to tune, train and test a model so it can easily be integrated into a CI/CD flow. This was attempted after viewing a [tutorial](https://morioh.com/p/d9fffafd5f92) on maintainable code.

The project itself is a regression model built on data scraped from SpareRoom.
